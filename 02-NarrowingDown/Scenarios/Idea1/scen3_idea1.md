### Scenario 3
#### Teacher 2 Faiza Kareem (Young)

Faiza Kareem is a maths teacher of this underprivileged school. Due to this hybrid mode he took the lectures twice a week because of this syllabus is running slow and the board exams is so near to take. He want to give the lecture once a time to offline and online student. We can suggest her to our application which she can easily take tests , queries, student interest and share all data which is required. She also take boards pens , marker in meeting to teach proper maths problem to her students.
