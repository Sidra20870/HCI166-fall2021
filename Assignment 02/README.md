History Of HCI
===================

## Questions In Our Mind ##

    Where did HCI come from?
    Who are the major personalities to work on this field?
    What are some important systems?

## Founder Of HCI ##

The HCI term declared or popular by both of him in 1983 book **The Psychology of Human-Computer Interaction** and first use in 1980 but first known in 1975.



## Father Of HCI ##

He is one of the father of this HCI feild.

 * Software Engineering
 * Software Human Factors
 * Computer Graphics
 * Cognitive Science

In 1980 the special areas of HCI is computer science , cognitive science and human factors engineering. These four roots from 1960s-1970s have grown widely and new 
mechanism is

 * Incorporated Broader 
 * Social Science
 * Networking
 * Media
 * Information Management
 * Artificial Intelligence

HCI has extended quickly for three decades, pulling in experts from numerous other disciplines and joining different concepts and approaches. To a significant degree, HCI presently totals a collection of semi-autonomous areas and human-centered informatics in the feild of reasearch and practise.

## Era's Of HCI ##
#### BY INPUT AND OUTPUT DEVICES ####
Early Days | Today | Soon
| :--- | ---: | :---:
**Input** | **Input** | **Input**
Wires | Keyboard | Data Gloves
Paper Tape | Cursor Keys | Data Suits
Punch Cards | Mouse | Computer Jewelry 
Keyboard etc | Microphone etc | Natural Language Cameras etc
**Output**| **Output** | **Output**
Lights on display paper| Scrolling Glass Teletype |Head Mounted Displays
Teletype  | Character Terminal | Ubiqoutous Computing
etc | Audo Bit | Multimedia 
etc  | Mapped Screen etc | Autonomous Agent etc

## Need Of HCI ##
At mid of 1960's world have to need HCI much because

* Interactive systems , not jobs
* Computer too expensive
* Time Sharing
* Memory Cheaper wanted

## Later 1970's ##
As it were people who connecting with computers but This changed problematically with the development of individual computing within the afterward 1970s. Individual computer perform our assignment in a incredible way  like word, spreadsheet etc but at fair the point when individual computing displayed the requirement of HCI, cognitive science displayed individuals, concepts, abilities, and a vision for tending to such needs of science. HCI was one of the best example of cognitive building.
