## Final 10 Ideas Selected

### IDEA 1: IDEA 1: Old Technology (original by [Dua Javeria])
If we create an app or a website, they may not have the access to a device for it like a phone or tablet. If you give it to them someone might steal it or sell it in their homes. Instead, maybe going with some technology they have access to, like a radio or FM device would be an option that can actually be done but its not an attending the session and to conduct the queries.

### IDEA 2: Share one device with lot of people (original by [Dua Javeria])
Although much attention has been paid to projects that promise things like 'an educational tablet for every student', it is not just about sectarian technologies like radio and television where the use of a device The benefits can reach many learners at once. As part of some projects, classrooms of up to 50 students can each 'operate' a computer independently, as long as each has its own mouse. Such efforts are enabled where technologies are available to help convert simple projectors into low-cost versions of digital whiteboards.

You need to make school management somehow to get this facility and for this a number of sponsors can be searched and contacted.

### IDEA 8:  Peer to Peer Learning (original by [Dua Javeria])
The increasing availability of low-cost video cameras (including in mobile phones) may provide opportunities for reflection and peer support for teachers who have little (if any) access to their curriculum delivery methods. for example, teachers take short videos of their peers and then jointly review and discuss teaching methods and particularly difficult topics as part of their professional development. Can be taught in informal, low-stack ways.

### IDEA 9:  Become a Mentor (original by [Dua Javeria] and [Sidra Usman])
You have to remember what's the main problem. Hybrid learning isn't the problem for Underprivileged kids but access to education is. Having someone to teach them when classes end and they need help that's the problem. Finding a way to provide extra class resources and coaches would be important so rather than using technology, finding volunteers who could teach after classes end, in the afternoon and evening would be important.

### IDEA 10: Publicize the cause of our product (original by [Sidra Usman])
Although you can donate out of your own pocket, you may want to encourage other people to donate as well. Advertise the charity of your choice to friends and family. Encourage others to make the most of your money. You might consider generalizing your goal: Social media like Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram Blogs Video appeals. Your personal website
