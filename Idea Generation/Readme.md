### Discover the Problem
In this idea the core word is **Underprivileged School** . According to this some of students have not resources to take online class as well schools also have not resources to manage hybrid classroom. They do not have enough ideas to manage the class by digital system.

---

### Focus on Scope 
Due to pandemic everyone is shifting towards online class but nowadays underpreviliged schools facing the problems as hybrid studies. So with various technologies and innovations we can create our education system to modern ecosystem. Our main focus is that how can we provide the digital system in this type of schools and if we can provide all the necessities to schools but how can we shift our students in digital area.

---

### Limitations
In hybrid mode of studies there are lot of limitations like
1. Sometimes students facing a problem to interact the teacher.
2. Attendence issues.
3. Virtual students facing learning over the computer especially te video and audio is not clear.
4. Access to resource.
5. Difficult to set up the complete classroom.

---

### Challenges
In this problem we make sure some challanges to solve that
1. Make sure educators need to deliver an excellent learning experience for students.
2. It can be challenge to keep both of students with teachers who can learn physically and remotely as well.
3. To teach that how to use this set up to students and teachers.
4. To provide the best resources and gadgets.
5. Handle technical issues like sounds, video, attention, wifi etc.
6. Collaboration is more difficult to facilitate.

### Regular Classroom VS Hybrid Classroom
In regular classroom where student engage with teahchers directly and access all the resource via teachers. Student solve their problems at a time , their work have complete on time. While in hybrid classroom students participate in complete work of class work and virtual work as well. Hybrid classes meet less frequently, with only a handful of in-person sessions per term. Educator provide the lesson in class and remotely as cameras at a time or to make schedule for some online and on-school classes. Meanwhile students can connect with
teachers and fellows as well. Video conferencing such as Zoom and Google Meeting and to check out of online students also like attendence, tests, exams etc. The Person which in class that engaged with teachers easily but often challenges with online students and there are lot of technology required like videos, images camera, website, schedule, resource, Artificial Intelligence , finger print etc. The main thing is that teacher can also see the students which can take classes by home.

---

### Solution by looking HCI
According to HCI, we can provide friendly environment in school , provide the best artifacts in school for better learning . To give automatic system and offer more flexible schedule to check out both offline and online students. We can interact with all the technologies and maintain a system a website or mobile app or to connect with all resource like computer, cameras, emails, Internert, automated gadgets etc wih easy and interactive user interface.

## Final 10 Ideas Selected

### IDEA 1: Old Technology (original by [Dua Javeria])
If we create an app or a website, they may not have the access to a device for it like a phone or tablet. If you give it to them someone might steal it or sell it in their homes. Instead, maybe going with some technology they have access to, like a radio or FM device would be an option that can actually be done but its not an attending the session and to conduct the queries.

|PROS|CONS|
|-|-|
|By Radio and TV broadcasting poor students can easily take the lectures.|But there is no interaction between teacher and students.|

### IDEA 2: Share one device with lot of people (original by [Dua Javeria])
Although much attention has been paid to projects that promise things like 'an educational tablet for every student', it is not just about sectarian technologies like radio and television where the use of a device The benefits can reach many learners at once. As part of some projects, classrooms of up to 50 students can each 'operate' a computer independently, as long as each has its own mouse. Such efforts are enabled where technologies are available to help convert simple projectors into low-cost versions of digital whiteboards.

### IDEA 4: Sponsorship (original by [Sidra Usman])
You need to make school management somehow to get this facility and for this a number of sponsors can be searched and contacted. Mobile companies or internet service providers may be the sponsors for providing this facility for schools or you may search over the internet for the potential sponsors like u can check for HEC funding for such projects.

### IDEA 5:  Offline Website (original by [Sidra Usman])
Some of the places have not current internet connectivity that we have innovative approach to catch online content due to distributive computation to offline resources but for this we have a cloud computing or once a time must have connectivity.

### IDEA 8:  Peer to Peer Learning (original by [Dua Javeria])
The increasing availability of low-cost video cameras (including in mobile phones) may provide opportunities for reflection and peer support for teachers who have little (if any) access to their curriculum delivery methods. for example, teachers take short videos of their peers and then jointly review and discuss teaching methods and particularly difficult topics as part of their professional development. Can be taught in informal, low-stack ways.

|PROS|CONS|

---
### IDEA 9:  Become a Mentor (original by [Dua Javeria] and [Sidra Usman])
You have to remember what's the main problem. Hybrid learning isn't the problem for Underprivileged kids but access to education is. Having someone to teach them when classes end and they need help that's the problem. Finding a way to provide extra class resources and coaches would be important so rather than using technology, finding volunteers who could teach after classes end, in the afternoon and evening would be important.

### IDEA 10: Publicize the cause of our product (original by [Dua Javeria])
Although you can donate out of your own pocket, you may want to encourage other people to donate as well. Advertise the charity of your choice to friends and family. Encourage others to make the most of your money. You might consider generalizing your goal: Social media like Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram Blogs Video appeals. Your personal website
