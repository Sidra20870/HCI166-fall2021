### Discover the Problem
In this idea the core word is **Underprivileged School** . According to this some of students have not resources to take online class as well schools also have not resources to manage hybrid classroom. They do not have enough ideas to manage the class by digital system.

---

### Focus on Scope 
Due to pandemic everyone is shifting towards online class but nowadays underpreviliged schools facing the problems as hybrid studies. So with various technologies and innovations we can create our education system to modern ecosystem. Our main focus is that how can we provide the digital system in this type of schools and if we can provide all the necessities to schools but how can we shift our students in digital area.

---

### Limitations
In hybrid mode of studies there are lot of limitations like
1. Sometimes students facing a problem to interact the teacher.
2. Attendence issues.
3. Virtual students facing learning over the computer especially te video and audio is not clear.
4. Access to resource.
5. Difficult to set up the complete classroom.

---

### Challenges
In this problem we make sure some challanges to solve that
1. Make sure educators need to deliver an excellent learning experience for students.
2. It can be challenge to keep both of students with teachers who can learn physically and remotely as well.
3. To teach that how to use this set up to students and teachers.
4. To provide the best resources and gadgets.
5. Handle technical issues like sounds, video, attention, wifi etc.
6. Collaboration is more difficult to facilitate.

### Regular Classroom VS Hybrid Classroom
In regular classroom where student engage with teahchers directly and access all the resource via teachers. Student solve their problems at a time , their work have complete on time. While in hybrid classroom students participate in complete work of class work and virtual work as well. Hybrid classes meet less frequently, with only a handful of in-person sessions per term. Educator provide the lesson in class and remotely as cameras at a time or to make schedule for some online and on-school classes. Meanwhile students can connect with
teachers and fellows as well. Video conferencing such as Zoom and Google Meeting and to check out of online students also like attendence, tests, exams etc. The Person which in class that engaged with teachers easily but often challenges with online students and there are lot of technology required like videos, images camera, website, schedule, resource, Artificial Intelligence , finger print etc. The main thing is that teacher can also see the students which can take classes by home.

### Solution by looking HCI
According to HCI, we can provide friendly environment in school , provide the best artifacts in school for better learning . To give automatic system and offer more flexible schedule to check out both offline and online students. We can interact with all the technologies and maintain a system a website or mobile app or to connect with all resource like computer, cameras, emails, Internert, automated gadgets etc wih easy and interactive user interface.

## Final 10 Ideas Selected

### IDEA 1: Old Technology (original by [Dua Javeria])
If we create an app or a website, they may not have the access to a device for it like a phone or tablet. If you give it to them someone might steal it or sell it in their homes. Instead, maybe going with some technology they have access to, like a radio or FM device would be an option that can actually be done but its not an attending the session and to conduct the queries.

|PROS|CONS|
|-|-|
|By Radio and TV broadcasting poor students can easily take the lectures.|But there is no interaction between teacher and students.|
|Broader student easily access to all opportunities.|No opportunity for question and feedback.|
|Copies of taped material (radio) can be made available to students for review.|Some courses technically hard but lack in the substance of teaching and learning.|

---
### IDEA 2: Share one device with lot of people (original by [Dua Javeria])
Although much attention has been paid to projects that promise things like 'an educational tablet for every student', it is not just about sectarian technologies like radio and television where the use of a device The benefits can reach many learners at once. As part of some projects, classrooms of up to 50 students can each 'operate' a computer independently, as long as each has its own mouse. Such efforts are enabled where technologies are available to help convert simple projectors into low-cost versions of digital whiteboards.

|PROS|CONS|
|-|-|
|Consistency occur, immediate access of all devices throughout the one of cable.|High dependency on school and centers.|
|Students can work simultaneously and collaborate each other easily.|If staff are not trained then they might be disable to handle the setup.|
|It can actually cheaper rather to donate separate devices.|Teachers may need to spend more time with the ame place or other place to teach the students as well.|

### IDEA 4: Sponsorship (original by [Sidra Usman])
You need to make school management somehow to get this facility and for this a number of sponsors can be searched and contacted. Mobile companies or internet service providers may be the sponsors for providing this facility for schools or you may search over the internet for the potential sponsors like u can check for HEC funding for such projects.

|-|-|
|It allows a school a school to buy and upgrade the equipment.|Misuse of data to create specific advertising the schools and may take direct amount on thier accounts.|
|It lowers the burden on parents and school staff.|Media & teams come and take more of time of students to gather the attention without permission.|
|It provides the students with the right education they need.|It may not have warranty after broken or snatching the devices.|

---
### IDEA 5:  Offline Website (original by [Sidra Usman])
Some of the places have not current internet connectivity that we have innovative approach to catch online content due to distributive computation to offline resources but for this we have a cloud computing or once a time must have connectivity.
|PROS|CONS|

|It is portable and one of the most interactive.|Students may lack to learn advance system , lacking of timings, some of recording andother data may not always available.|

---
### IDEA 6: Make Local Videos (original by [Duaa javeria])
After facing alot of problems we can make a local videos like record the lectures or teacher can make videos by own and share with students via mobile, TV, or applications.
and In this may teacher not conduct the class so students come in classroom and attend the lectures via these videos.

|-|-|
|Multiple videos on the same time to develop the concepts is useful.|If the teacher can't edit the videos students may get stress from noise|

|Students learn by the function of play and pause to understand much more about the topic.|Take a long bandwidth and memory cost for upload & downlod.|

---
### IDEA 7:  Asynchronous Learning (original by [Dua Javeria])
It allows to learn with your own schedule within the suitable time , you can access lectures, material, resources, work, at any time or after a weeks and months also. It mean two or kore people connect each other without present at a time like zoom and google meeting or virtual classroom.
|PROS|CONS|
|-|-|
|It allows to design their own learnung schedule.|Without a instructor it lack a personal touch.|
|Using boards & portal for discussion and editiong of documents to engage the students interest.|There is no real time interaction and collaboration.|
|It contain a more collection of videos, project, presentation and other mutimedia project and set a standard.|In this instant feedback is impossible to address the issues.|

---
### IDEA 8:  Peer to Peer Learning (original by [Dua Javeria])
The increasing availability of low-cost video cameras (including in mobile phones) may provide opportunities for reflection and peer support for teachers who have little (if any) access to their curriculum delivery methods. for example, teachers take short videos of their peers and then jointly review and discuss teaching methods and particularly difficult topics as part of their professional development. Can be taught in informal, low-stack ways.

|PROS|CONS|
|-|-|
|It involves participant of the same level engaging and collaborating.|It wants cost and energy to launch and maintain the system.|
|Teacher change the hosting of class and sharp minded student can teach the weaker student easily.|It is difficult to access the quality of peer to peer exercise and require extra resources to allocate the students and teachers both.|
|It can help to boost the students confidence and morale.|Individuals may not learn easily because they have no idea about experienced instructor.|

---
### IDEA 9:  Become a Mentor (original by [Dua Javeria] and [Sidra Usman])
You have to remember what's the main problem. Hybrid learning isn't the problem for Underprivileged kids but access to education is. Having someone to teach them when classes end and they need help that's the problem. Finding a way to provide extra class resources and coaches would be important so rather than using technology, finding volunteers who could teach after classes end, in the afternoon and evening would be important.


|PROS|CONS|
|-|-|
|Students can collaborate the teachers directly, if they not attend the class.|Instructor have not much time to attend the class and go to the students house for teaching.|
|The sense of achievement way better and take the assessment with good feedback.|It can depends on mentor menatality and tired level.|
|Self development of problem solving skill and enhance the confidence level.|If the person is being sick then the mentor may not go for teaching.|

---
### IDEA 10: Publicize the cause of our product (original by [Dua Javeria])
Although you can donate out of your own pocket, you may want to encourage other people to donate as well. Advertise the charity of your choice to friends and family. Encourage others to make the most of your money. You might consider generalizing your goal: Social media like Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram Blogs Video appeals. Your personal website

|PROS|CONS|
|-|-|
|It keeps the schools in the buisness of educating for money & devices.|Risk to get negative feedback and it will have a bad effect on the students. |
|It can enhance the device esposure through free press coverage.|Our AD compaign may costly in the case of mistake.|
|Improved conversion costs to maintain the value of users.|Our competitors can easily copy our strategy and we will be left empty handed|
