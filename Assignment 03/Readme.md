//In the group brain storming session shortlist the 60 ideas to 10. Discuss and keep noting why some ideas were scrapped, while some retained. Use a full sheet papers or chartpaper, printing paper etc. , you may use markers, pointers etc. If you can find a free classroom on campus use the whiteboard and take picture of that. use sticky notes etc.
